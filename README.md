# hello-world
Starting to learn GitHub is like surviving without my mother's cooking. It will get better eventually....I hope! If I could only branch off my siblings and improve each one. 

Hmmm something about myself....well you already know I have siblings and live away from home. I guess you could say my life is surrounded by volleyball. Be ready to listen to every single thing that happens in my life because I sure do like to talk.
